================================== Introduction: Gmail Auto Mail Sender ==================================

This Python script automates sending personalized email messages to multiple recipients
listed in an Excel file. It connects securely to the Gmail API using OAuth 2.0 authentication
and sends each email individually to ensure reliable delivery and avoid spam detection.

---------------------------------------- Features --------------------------------------------------------

- Reads recipient addresses from an Excel file named "Email List.xlsx" with a column titled "Email".
  (You must create this Excel file before running the script. Include only valid email addresses.)
- Sends a prewritten message to each recipient via Gmail API.
- Automatically handles Gmail authentication using credentials.json and token.pickle files.
- Tracks failed deliveries and updates the Excel file to keep only emails that failed to send.
- Encodes email messages in Base64, as required by Gmail API.
- Automates repetitive outreach tasks, saving time and reducing human error.

---------------------------------- Gmail API Setup Instructions ------------------------------------------

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and sign in with your Gmail account.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a **new project** (e.g., "Python Mail Sender").
3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable the **Gmail API** from the Google Cloud Console.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Go to "API's & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth Client ID".
5Ô∏è‚É£ Choose **Desktop App** and download the **credentials.json** file. (Important)
6Ô∏è‚É£ Save `credentials.json` in the same folder as this script.
7Ô∏è‚É£ When running the script for the first time, a browser window will open to authenticate
   and grant access. This will automatically generate a **token.pickle** file for future runs. (The "token" must be kept)

------------------------------------------ Important Notes -----------------------------------------------

- Keep `credentials.json` and `token.pickle` secure; do not share publicly.
- If 2FA is enabled, use an App Password or follow Gmail OAuth instructions to allow the script to send emails.
- Only valid email addresses in the Excel file will be processed. Empty or invalid entries are ignored.
- The script is ideal for job applications, recruitment, or professional outreach.
